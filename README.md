📊 Project Overview
The Godfathers – Crime Patterns in Major Cities is a group project focused on visualizing crime data across London, Liverpool, and Newcastle in 2023. The project analyzes spatial and temporal crime patterns, correlating them with population density, tourism, and income levels using official UK datasets.

This repository showcases an interactive map of crime incidents in Greater London, built using D3.js and Leaflet.js. It was developed as part of a collaborative data visualization project at King’s College London.

Key questions explored:

What crime types are most common in different parts of London?

How does tourism seasonality correlate with specific crimes like shoplifting?

Is there a spatial correlation between income, population density, and crime?

🔍 My Contribution
Built the interactive crime map using D3.js & Leaflet.

Cleaned and filtered the spatial data (Longitude/Latitude issues).

Ensured visual clarity using marker clustering and region toggling.

Hosted visualization on GitHub Pages for public accessibility.

Integrated Python to impute missing location data and refine map accuracy.
